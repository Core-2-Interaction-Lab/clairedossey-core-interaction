  <p>This webpage designed by Bradley showcases his mother's sticker collection he inherited. The site includes around 100 stickers and has information showcasing his love for each one, as well as, factual info.</p>

TYPOGRAPHY.......
Use of neue-kabel font gives the site a retro feel, but also holds strong angular structure to mimic the geometric, 80s sticker feel.
The chosen colors of the site, ie background and font, are simply black and white to allow the loudness of the stickers to show.</div>

INTUITIVENESS.......
The header and footer is fixed so on scroll they stay positioned on screen. I think this addition creates professionalism to the sight, but also gives the user a reminder about the real importance of the collection and the relation to the designer.
I think the use of hovering to reveal information is smart and allows the sight to have the collage feel of stickers in a sticker sheet, rather than words that disrupt that design attribute.

        TYPOGRAPHY.......
        The about page still maintains the same typographical aspects of the homepage but this page has increased font size for its bulk of text.
        The text is also fixed on tha page so on scroll the rest of the portrait is revealed but the text remains legable and the main focus of the page, as well as allowing the portrait to hold importance and be showcased.

<div id="text5">
INTUITIVENESS.......
Upon clicking the footer of the homepage we are taken to the about page. This page holds information about the collection and the original collector, the designers mom. the information is clear and the positions of the image and text allow for a smart visual language.

    <div id="img4"><img src="assets/gifs/mobile.gif" alt="mobile gif" style="max-width: 350%;"></div>
<div id="text6">
    INTUITIVENESS.......
The images are small but readable.
Scrolling through on a hand-held devise pushes the idea of a sticker packet.
Think the changes in the about page allow the mobile version to remain legable and easy to access.
