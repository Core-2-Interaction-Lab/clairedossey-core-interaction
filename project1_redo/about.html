        On Beginnings, by Mary Ruefle, is about how poems donâ€™t have endings. I decided to think about how beginnings work and what no endings mean in terms of evolving and ever changing. I ended up thinking about technology and the never ending re-working of computers and other tech. With this idea I created the site inspired by computers from the 80s. I used a black background and green type with a digital, almost dialog, typeface. I also used javascript to create an animation of the paragraphs being typed down the page, to add intuitiveness I added more java to allow the page to be instantly filled by touching the space bar. Mary Ruefle also mentions many authors and people that talk about this idea of beginnings or poets she find exemplify her point. I linked each author our to a page about them or their websites.
