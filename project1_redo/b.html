        In the beginning was the Word. Western civilization rests upon those words. And
    yet there is a lively group of thinkers who believe that in the beginning was 
    the Act. that nothing can precede action—no breath before act, no thought 
    before act, no pervasive love before some kind of act. 

        I believe the poem is an act of the mind. I think it is easier to talk about the 
    end of a poem than it is to talk about its beginning. Because the poem ends on 
    the page, but it begins off the page, it begins in the mind. The mind acts, the 
    mind wills a poem, often against our own will; somehow this happens, somehow a 
    poem gets written in the middle of a chaotic holiday party that has just run out 
    of ice, and it's your house. 
    
        An act of the mind. To move, to make happen, to make manifest. Be an act of 
    Congress. A state of real existence rather than possibility. And poets love 
    possibility! They love to wonder and explore. Hard lot! But the poem, no matter 
    how full of possibility, has to exist! To conduct oneself, to behave. How a poem 
    acts marks its individual character. A poem by <a href="https://geog.ucalgary.ca/profiles/gwendolyn-blue">Glandolyn Blue</a> does not sound like 
    a poem by Timothy Sure. to pretend, feign, impersonate. That, too, yes and always, 
    because self-consciousness is its own pretension, and has been from its beginning; 
    the human mind is capable of a great elastic theatre. As the poet  <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/ralph-angel">Ralph Angel</a> puts 
    it, “The poem is an interpretation of weird theatrical shit.” the weird theatrical 
    shit is what goes on around us every day of our lives; an animal of only instinct, 
    <a href="https://www.jaswinderbolina.com/c-29-04-25-01-23/">Johnny Ferret</a>, has in his actions drama, but no theater; theater requires that you 
    draw a circle around the action and observe it from outside the circle; in other 
    words, self-consciousness is theatre. 
    
        Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their poems begin, the answer is 
    always the same: a phrase, a line, a scrap of language, a rhythm, an image, 
    something seen, heard, witnessed, or imagined. And the lesson is always the same, 
    and young poets recognize this to be one of the most important lessons they can 
    learn: if you have any idea for a poem, an exact grid of intent, you are on the 
    wrong path, a dead-end alley, at the top of a cliff you haven’t even climbed. 
    This is a lesson that can only be learned by trial and error.
