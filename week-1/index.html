    <p>1. I have only taken a core 1 Intereaction class on codeing last semester, with no previous coding experience prior. We worked mostly in HTML and CSS, but we had barely touch JS so I would say JS is most confusing to me. I like CSS cause I like changing the colors and images in things.
 </p>
 <p>2. I am excited to learn code becuase I want to be able to code my own portfolio website. I am nervous because it feels like a lot of language to learn, but I know it is do-able.</p>
<p>3. Although i dont really imagine wanting to do a lot eith coding after college, I know that codeing is a useful skill and I probably will be expected to use it. </p>
<p>4. I prefure to code in CSS when altering text</p>
<p>5. I have not used Github, but I know it is a domain to host websites.</p>
<p>6. I like to think of HTML the brittle bones of a website, consisting of type and sections of divs. CSS is the flesh of the website giving color and order. JS is the brain telling the website how to preform.</p>

<p><ul>https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/?ref=httpster.net</ul> Sometimes i feel like using 3D graphics or a lot of interaction, although cool can feel gimicy to me. I like that this website has intresting color and feel, but also is eco-friendly.</p>
